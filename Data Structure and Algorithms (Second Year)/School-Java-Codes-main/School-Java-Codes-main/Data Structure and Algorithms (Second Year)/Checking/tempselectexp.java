/*

scanner.nextLine(): This part of the code reads the next line of input from the user. It waits for the user to enter a line of text and press the "Enter" key. The entered line, which is assumed to be a string, is then returned as a string by the nextLine() method.

Integer.parseInt(...): After reading the line of input as a string, the code attempts to convert that string into an integer using the Integer.parseInt() method. This method takes a string as an argument and tries to parse it into an integer. If the string contains a valid integer representation (e.g., "123"), it will be converted into an integer. If the string cannot be parsed as an integer (e.g., "abc" or "1.23"), a NumberFormatException will be thrown.

size = ...: Finally, the result of the Integer.parseInt(...) method (which is an integer) is assigned to the variable size. This allows you to use the size variable in your code to work with the user's input as an integer.

In summary, this line of code reads a line of text input from the user, attempts to convert it into an integer, and assigns the integer value to the size variable. It's commonly used for input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid integer within the specified range.
